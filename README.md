# 🔒 Secure Encrypted Messaging System
**🌀 Lava Lamp PRNG-Driven Encryption for Network Communication**

This project demonstrates an innovative approach to cryptography by using lava lamps to generate entropy for a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). The Secure Encrypted Messaging System integrates advanced data structures, socket programming, and a novel source of entropy to ensure robust and secure communication.

## 📝 Abstract
The system leverages the chaotic and unpredictable behavior of lava lamps to capture entropy, enhancing encryption robustness. By combining this with AVL trees for key management, socket programming for client-server communication, and efficient data structures, the system achieves secure and efficient messaging.

## 🌟 Features
- 🛠️ **Entropy Source**: Utilizes lava lamp visuals captured via OpenCV.
- 🔑 **Encryption Algorithm**: RC4 stream cipher with PRNG-driven keys.
- 📂 **Key Management**: AVL trees and dynamic key rotation for enhanced security.
- 🌐 **Client-Server Communication**: Based on Boost.Asio for reliable socket programming.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🔐 Develop a secure messaging system with robust encryption.
- 📸 Implement visual entropy capture from lava lamps for PRNG.
- 📊 Employ efficient data structures like AVL trees and queues for key management.
- 🤝 Enable seamless communication using a client-server model.
